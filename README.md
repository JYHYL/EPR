## Dataset
The dataset is too large to upload directly to GitHub. You can download the zipped file from the following Google Drive link:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hxtQ_42ra7FBgRsxAbqTIIqd4H5y2sK3/view?usp=sharing

## Steps to Reproduce
### **1. Download and unzip the dataset**  
     After downloading 'netcdf_files.zip', decompress it to extract the files.
### **2. Place the following folders in the same directory as the dataset:**
   - '01_Consolidation files.ipynb'
       This notebook is used to merge files generated by the same simulator into a single  dataset.
   - '02_EDA_and_Preprocessing_02.ipynb'
      This notebook includes data inspection, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) steps. Key tasks:
      #### Data Overview
      - Summary of dataset structure and variable coverage
      - Comparison of key variables between the first and last 10 years to observe long-term changes
    
      #### Preprocessing
      1. Split merged datetime into separate 'year', 'month', and 'day' columns  
      2. Compute spatial mean and temporal mean for each variable and save them as files  
      3. Filter the data by location to retain only grid points within the UK region and save as NetCDF files
      4. Visualise the spatial distribution of selected locations and temperature 
      
      #### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
      1. Visualise temporal trends of all variables
      2. Generate pairwise scatter plots to explore relationships between variables   
      3. Use boxplots to analyse how temperature relates to other variables  
      4. Compute correlation matrix and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to assess multicollinearity
### 3. **Run the code as needed**
   Start from '01_Consolidation files.ipynb', followed by '02_EDA_and_Preprocessing_02.ipynb'.
